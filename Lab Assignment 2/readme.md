## Assignment Problems

### Problem 1: Finite Difference Table

**Description:**  
 Given the data:

| x   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y   | 1   | 8   | 27  | 64  | 125 |

Write a program to generate the finite (difference) table for these values.

### Problem 2: Newton's Forward Interpolation

**Description:**  
 Using the same dataset as in Problem 1:

| x   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y   | 1   | 8   | 27  | 64  | 125 |

Write a program to approximate the value of \( y \) when \( x = 1.7 \) using Newton's forward interpolation formula.

### Problem 3: Newton's Backward Interpolation

**Description:**  
 Using the following data points:

| x   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y   | 1   | 8   | 27  | 64  | 125 |

Write a program to approximate the value of \( y \) when \( x = 4.7 \) using Newton's backward interpolation formula.

### Problem 4: Lagrange's Inverse Interpolation

**Description:**  
 With the same data as in Problem 1:

| x   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y   | 1   | 8   | 27  | 64  | 125 |

Write a program to determine the value of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 85 \) using Lagrangeâ€™s inverse interpolation formula.

### Problem 5: Newton's Divided Difference Formula

**Description:**  
 Consider the following data points:

| x   | 1   | 3   | 4   | 6   | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y   | 0   | 18  | 58  | 190 | 920 |

Write a program to approximate the value of \( y \) when \( x = 2.7 \) using Newton's divided difference formula.
