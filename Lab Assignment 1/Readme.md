   Write a program to round off a number with `n` significant figures using Banker's rule.

3. **Polynomial Evaluation using Horner's Rule**  
   Write a program to evaluate the polynomial:

   \[ f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + 10 \]  
   using Horner's rule for \( x = 5 \).

4. **Root Finding using Bisection Method**  
   Write a program to find the root of the equation:

   \[ x^3 - 9x + 1 = 0 \]  
   correct to three decimal places using the bisection method.

5. **Finding All Roots using Bisection Method**  
   Write a program to find all the roots of the equation:

   \[ x^3 - 6x + 4 = 0 \]  
   correct to three decimal places using the bisection method.

6. **Root Finding using Newton-Raphson Method**  
   Write a program to find the root of the equation:

   \[ x^3 - 6x + 4 = 0 \]  
   correct to three decimal places using the Newton-Raphson method.

7. **Root Finding using False Position Method**  
   Write a program to find the root of the equation:

   correct to three decimal places using the false position method.

8. **Root Finding using Secant Method**  
   Write a program to find the root of the equation:

   \[ x^3 - 5x^2 - 29 = 0 \]  
   correct to three decimal places using the secant method.

9. **Finding the Quotient Polynomial**  
   Write a program to find the quotient polynomial \( q(x) \) such that:

   \[ p(x) = (x - 2) q(x) \]  
   where \( p(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 8 \) has a root at \( x = 2 \).

10. **Finding All Roots using Newton-Raphson Method with Deflation**
